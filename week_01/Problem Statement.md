## Problem Statement: 
Given an array of nonnegative shorted integers, design a binary algorithm and implement it using a program to find whether a given key element is present in the array or not.  (Time Complexity = O(logn), where n is the size of the input).

## Sample Input:
```
2
7
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
6
5 
1 2 3 4 5
8
```

## Sample Output:
```
key is present
Key not present
```
