# Week 00: 

> # Linear Search

## Problem Statement: 
Given an array of nonnegative integers, design a linear algorithm and implement it using a program to find whether a given key element is present in the array or not. Also, find the total number of comparisons for each input case. (Time Complexity = O(n), where n is the size of input).

## Sample Input:
```
2
5 2
1 2 3 4 5
3 4
1 2 3
```

## Sample Output:
```
yes your key is present', '-', 1
Key not found
```
